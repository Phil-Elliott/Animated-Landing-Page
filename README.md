# Elanor Cars Landing Page




An interactive and dynamic landing page using React and styled components. I copied the design from Figma. 

## What I learned

This was pretty simple, but I was able to learn styled components and how to use Figma to copy a design. I also learned some better ways to make websites responsive. I really like using clamp to make the typography responsive.
